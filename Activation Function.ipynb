They determine the output of a neuron given its input or the weighted sum of inputs, introducing non-linearity into the network's computations. This non-linearity allows the network to learn and approximate a wide range of functions, enabling it to model complex relationships in the data.\n","\n","### Role of Activation Functions:\n","1. **Introducing Non-linearity**: Without activation functions, a neural network would essentially behave like a linear transformation of the input data (i.e., a linear model). Activation functions add non-linearity, allowing the network to model more complex functions.\n","2. **Controlling Output**: Activation functions also determine the range of the output. For example, a sigmoid function maps inputs to an output range between 0 and 1, making it suitable for probabilistic outputs.\n","3. **Enabling Learning**: By determining how much information gets passed forward in the network, activation functions affect the learning process and convergence during training.\n","\n","### Linear vs. Nonlinear Activation Functions:\n","\n","1. **Linear Activation Functions**:\n","   - **Definition**: A linear activation function can be expressed as \\( f(x) = x \\). This means that the output is directly proportional to the input.\n","   - **Characteristics**:\n","     - Easy to compute.\n","     - Maintains the same dimensionality of inputs and outputs.\n","     - Allows for simple composition of linear functions.\n","   - **Limitations**:\n","     - Stacking multiple layers with linear activation leads to a linear combination of inputs, resulting in no added representational power.\n","      Essentially, no matter how many layers you add, the entire network still behaves like a single-layer linear model.\n","     - Therefore, linear activation functions do not enable the network to learn complex patterns.\n","\n","2. **Nonlinear Activation Functions**:\n","   - **Types**: Common non-linear activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, softmax, etc.\n","   - **Characteristics**:\n","     - Introduce non-linearities that enable deep networks to learn complex representations.\n","     - They can shape the output in a way that can model the underlying underlying distributions more effectively.\n","   - **Examples**:\n","     - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: \\( f(x) = \\max(0, x) \\) introduces sparsity, helping to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n","     - **Sigmoid**: \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\) maps values between 0 and 1, but is prone to vanishing gradients for extreme inputs.\n","     - **Tanh**: \\( f(x) = \\tanh(x) \\) maps values between -1 and 1, often preferred over sigmoid.\n","   - **Benefits**:\n","     - Greater flexibility in fitting a variety of functions.\n","     - Allows gradient-based optimization techniques (like backpropagation) to work effectively across many layers.\n","\n","### Preference for Nonlinear Activation Functions in Hidden Layers:\n","Nonlinear activation functions are preferred in hidden layers for several reasons:\n","\n","1. **Complexity and Expressiveness**: Non-linear functions allow multi-layer networks to approximate complex mappings between inputs and outputs. This expressiveness is essential for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and other applications that require understanding patterns.\n","\n","2. **Deep Architectures**: Nonlinear activation functions enable the use of deep architectures with many layers,\n","    facilitating the learning of hierarchical features. Each subsequent layer can extract increasingly abstract features from the previous layer's output.\n","\n","3. **Handling Linearity**: If all layers of a neural network used linear activation functions, regardless of the number of layers,\n"," the entire network would still behave as a single linear transformation, limiting the network's capacity for learning complex structures in the data.\n","\n","In conclusion, activation functions enable neural networks to learn non-linear relationships essential for tackling complex tasks, with non-linear activation functions being fundamental to the architecture and functioning of multi-layered networks."],"metadata":{"id":"-JgOblUlOh1Q"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2.Describe the Sigmoid activation function.
